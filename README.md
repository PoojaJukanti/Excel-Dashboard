# Excel-Dashboard
Created a dynamic Excel dashboard for in-depth analysis of UK road accident data. It reveals key insights like total casualties, fatal, serious, and slight casualties, road-type KPIs, and year-over-year comparisons. The dashboard features a dynamic line chart showing monthly casualty trends compared to the previous year, a bar chart for casualties by road type, a tree chart for casualties by road surface, and a donut chart highlighting the percentage of casualties by location and lighting conditions.
